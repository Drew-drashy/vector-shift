# VectorShift - Pipeline Editor

VectorShift's Pipeline Editor is a web application designed to help users create and analyze graph pipelines. The frontend allows users to input nodes and edges, while the backend processes the graph to determine if it forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and provides additional details.

---

## Features

### **Frontend**
- Create a graph by specifying:
  - Number of nodes (`V`).
  - Directed edges (`from â†’ to` format).
- Display the added edges.
- Submit the graph to the backend for analysis.
- Clear the current graph data.
- Display results, including:
  - Number of nodes.
  - Number of edges.
  - Whether the graph is a DAG.
  - Topological order (if applicable).

### **Backend**
- Processes the graph to:
  - Count nodes and edges.
  - Check if the graph forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Kahn's Algorithm.
  - Return the topological order if the graph is a DAG.

## Setup Instructions

### **Frontend**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Example Usage
Frontend:

Input V = 4.
Add edges 1 â†’ 2, 2 â†’ 3, and 3 â†’ 4.
Submit the graph.
View results:
Nodes: 4
Edges: 3
Is DAG: Yes
Topological Order: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4
Backend:

Receives the graph as an adjacency list.
Returns the results to the frontend after processing.
